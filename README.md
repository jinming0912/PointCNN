setting: same as PointCNN (without x_transform)

layers:

x = 3
xconv_params = [dict(zip(xconv_param_name, xconv_param)) for xconv_param in
                [(8, 1, -1, 16 * x, []),
                 (12, 2, 384, 32 * x, []),
                 (16, 2, 128, 64 * x, []),
                 (16, 3, 128, 128 * x, [])]]

performance: 90.88%
